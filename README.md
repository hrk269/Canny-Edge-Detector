#	Implemented the Canny Edge Detector in Python to output a certain percentage of edge pixels 
#	Performed gaussian smoothing, gradient operations, and non-maxima suppression on a grayscale image
#	Calculated a cutoff grayscale value using a specified threshold percentage 
#	Reassigned pixels with a grayscale value less than the threshold cutoff to a value of 0 (black)
#	Returned a normalized binary image showing only a specified percentage of edge pixels
